    "description": "A service for automatically extracting information about what topics are covered in the texts. It uses topic modeling (LDA), which detects topics based on the co-occurrence of words in one document. The service assigns each document to several topics. The detected topic represents what a list of pairs: the word and the probability of its occurrence in the topic. It enables qualitative (detection of non-obvious topics) and quantitative analysis of processed texts.",

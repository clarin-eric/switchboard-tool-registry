    "description": "The Polish dependency parser is trained on the extended version of the Polish dependency treebank (Składnica zależnościowa) with the publicly available parsing systems – MaltParser or MateParser. MaltParser is a transition-based dependency parser that uses a deterministic parsing algorithm. The deterministic parsing algorithm builds a dependency structure of an input sentence based on transitions (shift-reduce actions) predicted by a classifier. The classifier learns to predict the next transition given training data and the parse history. MateParser, in turn, is a graph-based parser that defines a space of well-formed candidate dependency trees for an input sentence, scores them given an induced parsing model, and selects the highest scoring dependency tree as a correct analysis of the input sentence.
